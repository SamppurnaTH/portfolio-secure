## ✅ Critical Fixes Implemented

- **NoSQL Injection** – sanitized search queries.  
- **Unprotected File Uploads** – added `requireAdmin` middleware, type & size validation.  
- **Sensitive Data Exposure** – removed hardcoded contact details, migrated to env vars.  
- **Token Security** – standardized on **HTTP-only cookies**, removed localStorage usage.  

---

## 🛡️ Security Enhancements

- **Centralized Security Config** (`lib/security.ts`) with CSP, rate limiting, env validation.  
- **Input Validation & Sanitization** – Zod schemas, XSS prevention, file validation.  
- **Authentication & Authorization** – bcrypt (12 rounds), role-based access, session mgmt.  
- **File Upload Security** – Cloudinary integration, secure file validation.
